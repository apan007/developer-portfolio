            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.

            <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them.
            They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
